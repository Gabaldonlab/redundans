* :::+ and ::::+ work like ::: and :::: but links this input source to
  the previous input source in a --xapply fashion. Contrary to
  --xapply values do not wrap: The shortest input source determines
  the length.

* --line-buffer --keep-order now outputs continously from the oldest
  job still running. This is more what you would expect than the
  earlier behaviour where --keep-order had no effect with
  --line-buffer.

* env_parallel supports tcsh, csh, pdksh. In fish it now supports
  arrays. In csh/tcsh it now supports variables, aliases, and arrays
  with no special chars. In pdksh it supports aliases, functions,
  variables, and arrays.

* Function exporting on Mac OS X works around old Bash version.

* Better CPU detection on OpenIndiana.

* --sql DBURL uses DBURL as storage for jobs and output. It does not
  run any jobs so it requires at least one --sqlworker. DBURL must
  point to a table.

* --sqlworker DBURL gets jobs from DBURL and stores the result back to
  DBURL.

* --sqlandworker is a shorthand for --sql and --sqlworker.

* --sqlworker requires the output of a single job to fit in memory.

* --results now also saves a file called 'seq' containing the sequence
  number.

* If $PARALLEL_ENV is a file, then that file will be read into
  $PARALLEL_ENV.

* man parallel_tutorial has been given an overhaul.

* --halt has been rewritten completely. You can now combine
  percentages with success or fail. See the man page.

* Exit values 102..254 have been removed. 101 means more than 100 jobs
  failed.

* Killing through --timeout, --memfree, or --halt is now done as a
  process group.

* --termseq determines which signals are sent when a job is killed.

* An empty argument would previously cause no string to be
  inserted. This is now changed to '' being inserted, thus prepending
  a space to the output of: parallel echo {} b ::: ''

* $PARALLEL_ENV can now be set to an environment prepending the
  command. Used in env_parallel as mentioned in the manpage.

* --retry-failed will retry all failed jobs in a joblog. It will
  ignore any command given.

* --ssh and $PARALLEL_SSH can be used to set the command used for
  ssh. The command is assumed to behave the same way as ssh.

* --fifo now works in csh, too.

* Q(...) can be used in {= =} to shell quote a string.

20150422

New in this release:

* Security fix. An attacker on the local system could make you
  overwrite one of your own files with a single byte. The problem
  exist when you use --compress or --tmux or --pipe or --cat or
  --fifo. The attacker must figure out the randomly chosen file name
  and create a symlink within a time window of 15 ms.

* --shuf will generate all jobs, and shuffle them before running
  them. This is useful to get a quick preview of the results before
  running the full batch.

20150122

* Remote jobs now send stderr (standard error) to stderr (standard
  error) instead of stdout (standard output).

* Remote execution command is now packed using base64 encoded
  bzip2. This means that big environments (app. 100 KB) can be
  transferred. This change makes remote execution alpha quality.

* --semaphoretimeout now takes a negative value. This means give up if
  the semaphore is not gotten within the timeout.

* --halt -1 and -2 now means halt if a job succeeds (so the opposite
  of 1 and 2).

* --no-keep-order will reverse --keep-order.

* Bash's second fix of shellshock caused --env to break again when
  exporting functions. This has been fixed again.

* A semibig refactoring of big functions. All non-trivial functions
  are now less than 100 lines. The refactoring makes this release beta
  quality.

* A description of the design decisions for GNU Parallel can be found
  in 'man parallel_design'.

* A bug fix in replacement strings caused rewrite of the replacement
  function. This makes use of replacement strings alpha quality.

* Remote systems can be divided into hostgroups (e.g. web and db) by
  prepending '@groupname/' to the sshlogin. Multiple groups can be
  given by separating groups with '+'. E.g. @web/www1 @web+db/www2
  @db/mariadb

* Remote execution can be restricted to servers that are part of one
  or more groups by '@groupname' as an sshlogin. Multiple groups can
  be given by separating groups with '+'. E.g. -S @web or -S @db+web

* With --hostgroup you can restrict arguments to certain hostgroups by
  appending '@groupname' to the argument.  Multiple groups can be
  given by separating groups with '+'. E.g. my_web_arg@web
  db-or-web-arg@db+web db-only-arg@db Thanks to Michel Courtine for
  developing a prototype for this.

* GNU Parallel now uses the same shell it was started from as the
  command shell for local jobs. So if GNU Parallel is started from
  tcsh it will use tcsh as its shell even if the login $SHELL is
  different. For remote jobs the login $SHELL will be used.

* The whole current environment in bash can be copied by using a shell
  wrapper function (Search manual for env_parallel).

* --plus adds the replacement strings {+/} {+.} {+..} {+...} {..}
  {...} {/..} {/...}. The idea being that '+foo' matches the opposite
  of 'foo' and {} = {+/}/{/} = {.}.{+.} = {+/}/{/.}.{+.} = {..}.{+..}
  = {+/}/{/..}.{+..} = {...}.{+...} = {+/}/{/...}.{+...}

* {= perl expression =} can be used as replacement string. The
  expression should modify $_. E.g. {= s/\.gz$// =} to remove .gz from
  the string. This makes replacement strings extremely flexible.

* Positional perl expressions (similar to {2}) are given as {=2 perl
  expression=} where 2 is the position.

* One small backwards incompatibility: {1}_{2} will replace {2} with
  the empty string if there is only one argument. Previously {2} would
  have been left untouched.

* Replacement strings can be defined using --rpl. E.g. parallel --rpl
  '{.gz} s/\.gz$//' echo {.gz} ::: *.gz

* The parenthesis around {= perl expression =} can be changed with
  --parens.

* --tmux will direct the output to a tmux session instead of
  files. Each running jobs will be in its own window.

* --halt 10% will stop spawning new jobs if 10% failed so far.

* --pipepart is a highly efficient alternative to --pipe if the input
  is a real file and not a pipe.

* If using --cat or --fifo with --pipe the {} in the command will be
  replaced with the name of a physical file and a fifo respectively
  containing the block from --pipe. Useful for commands that cannot
  read from standard input (stdin).

* --controlmaster has gotten an overhaul and is no longer
  experimental.

* --env is now copied when determining CPUs on remote system. Useful
  for copying $PATH if parallel is not in the normal path.

* --results now chops the argument if the argument is longer than the
  allowed path length.

* Build now survives if pod2* are not installed.

* The git repository now contains tags of releases.

  --bibtex once. This makes the release alpha quality.

* --compress will compress temporary files. If the output is big and
  very compressible this will take up less disk space in $TMPDIR and
  possibly be faster due to less disk I/O.

* --compress-program comtrols which program to use for compressing
  temporary files.

* --bar show progress as a progress bar compatible with zenity.

* --resume can now be used with --result: Jobs already run will be
  skipped.

* A tutorial showing much of GNU Parallel's functionality. Spend an
  hour walking through the tutorial. Your commandline will love you
  for it. man parallel_tutorial

* --line-buffer will buffer output on line basis. --group keeps the
  output together for a whole job. --ungroup allows output to mixup
  with half a line coming from one job and half a line coming from
  another job. --line-buffer fits between these two; it prints a full
  line, but will allow for mixing lines of different jobs.

* --record-env records all variables and functions set. Useful to
  record the normal environment before using --env _.

* --env _ exports all functions and variables to the remote server
  except for the ones recorded.

* New signing key. Due to recommendations from NIST

* --ctrlc is now default if --pipe is not used; thus making it
  possible to kill remotely started jobs simply by pressing Ctrl-C.

* --timeout 200% now means kill jobs that take more than twice the
  time of the median run time of a job.

* Jobs are now distributed round robin when having mulitiple
  --sshlogin instead of filling up one --sshlogin at a time.

* niceload: darwin version of --io --mem --swap. Thanks to Anders F
  Björklund.

* Bug fixes and man page updates.


20130422

* 10 seconds installation: wget -O - pi.dk/3 | sh

* HPUX CPU/core detection. Thanks to Javier Tarradas.

* CPU detection for HURD, IRIX, SCO OpenServer and (old) HPUX.

* --ctrlc will send SIGINT to tasks running on remote computers and
  thus killing them.

  processes instead of 'uptime' thus making --load react much faster.

* Testing on Centos 3.9 and FreeBSD 7 revealed a lot of compability
  bugs. Some of these required quite extensive changes making this
  release beta quality.

20120622

* '-L n --pipe' will use records of n lines. This is useful when
  processing data that have fixed records with a fixed number of
  lines (e.g. fastq).

* --filter-hosts will remove down hosts. For each remote host: check
  that login through ssh works. If not: do not use this host.
  Currently you can not put --filter-hosts in a profile, $PARALLEL,
  /etc/parallel/config or similar. This is because GNU Parallel uses
  GNU Parallel to compute this, so you will get an infinite loop. This
  will likely be fixed in a later release.

* --pipe now uses fork() instead of busy wait. The performance should
  be better on computers with >10 cores while remaining the same on
  computers with few cores.

* GNU Parallel will be represented at Chiang Mai Bar Camp.

  below a certain limit.

* niceload: --run-noswap will slow down a program if the computer is
  swapping.

* niceload: --start-io, --start-load, --start-mem, --start-noswap will
  defer starting a program until the system is below the limit.

* --io, --load, --mem, and --noswap sets both --run-* and --start-*.

* niceload got a major rewrite and is now object oriented.

* Multiple ::: can be put on the command line and will be treated
  similar to contents from multiple -a's.

* ::: and :::: can now be mixed on the command line. Use {1} .. {n} to
  refer to inputs from the different input sources.

* --xapply is now needed to get xapply's behaviour of reading one line
  from each of the input sources.

* Multiple input sources will cause all combinations of arguments from
  the sources to be generated. E.g. 'parallel echo {1}+{2} ::: 1 2 :::
  a b c' will print 1+a 1+b 1+c 2+a 2+b 2+c. This can often replace
  nested loops.

* Implemented {//} for the input line with the basename removed (dirname).

* --gnu will force GNU Parallel to behave like GNU Parallel even if
  --tollef is set.

* Site wide config file: /etc/parallel/config

  This should solve the issue with some packagers renaming GNU
  Parallel to gparallel to avoid the naming conflict.

  By putting --tollef in the site wide config file you can deinstall
  Tollef's parallel and install GNU Parallel instead without any
  change for users or scripts. This is useful for packagers that
  currently rename GNU Parallel or simply do not distribute GNU
  Parallel because the command name conflicts with Tollef's parallel.

* -L 0 -n 0, and -N 0 implemented. They will read one argument,
  but insert 0 arguments on the command line. Useful if you just want
  to run the same command with the same arguments a number of times.

* GNU Parallel is now in Fink. Thanks to Jesse Alama.

* --pipe splits piped data into blocks. Each block is piped to a
  program for processing. The piping and the programs will be run in
  parallel. Useful if the data you want to process is data for a
  program and not arguments.

* --blocksize sets the blocksize in bytes for --pipe. The blocksize is
  approximate. It can deviate as much as the size of one record.
  Default is 1M.

* --recstart sets the string matching the start of a
  record. Default is "".

* --recend sets the string matching the end of a
  record. Default is '\n'. To specify none use --recend "".

  If both --recstart and --recend are set, the end of a record must be
  followed immediately by a start of a record. This is useful if
  either recend or recstart can occur in the middle of a record.

* --remove-rec-sep removes the string matched by --recstart and
  --recend.

* --regexp will make GNU Parallel treat --recstart and --recend as
  regular expressions.

* --output-as-files will put the output of the programs into files and
  instead of giving the output GNU Parallel will output the name of
  these files.

* -N if used with --pipe sets the number of records to read.

* New video showing --pipe at

* --joblog makes a simple log of completed jobs.

* -X now spreads arguments between job slots when reaching last
  argument. Use -j1 to avoid this.

* GNU niceload is now part of GNU Parallel. GNU niceload slows down a
  program if the load average is above a certain limit.

* Implemented --tmpdir to buffer standard output and standard error in
  a different place.

* Implemented --load to wait until the load is below a limit before
  starting another job on that computer.

* Implemented --nice set the niceness of jobs running both locally and
  remotely.

* Implemented --dry-run to print the job without running it.

* Implemented --tty as the old default of assigning a tty to the first
  job causes problems.

* Review with focus on clusters. Thanks to Taylor Gillespie

* Quite a few bug fixes and man page updates.


20101202

* Implemented {/} for the input line with the path removed (basename).

* Implemented {/.} for the input line with extension and path removed
  (basename).

* Output from --progress is now sent to standard error instead of
  standard output.

* --eta was broken and counted down from 0. Now fixed.

* Standard output and standard error are flushed after every job so if
  standard output does not end with a newline it will still be grouped
  with the rest of standard output.

* --command, -c, --file, and -f are now removed as options. They were
  never used in practice.

* GetOptionsFromArray rewritten to work with old Perl libraries.

* The file COPYING now contains the GNU General Public License 3

* Major rewrite to make the code more object oriented and easier to
  maintain in the future.


20101113

* Using -j myfile the number of jobs can be changed while GNU Parallel
  is running simply by changing the content of myfile.

* Implemented --profile to use different .parallel/config for
  different situations.

* Ugly newlines in $PARALLEL and .parallel/config are no longer
  needed.  Instead you have to use \ in front of special shell
  characters.

* --workdir puts the files transferred to remote machines in a
  specified directory.

* $PARALLEL_PID is set to the process id of GNU Parallel.

* $PARALLEL_SEQ is set to the sequence number of the job.

* -v now only shows the command to run. Use -v -v to show the
   ssh/rsync wrapping.

* Slow spawning error is now only a warning.

* If stdin is a tty and input is read from stdin you now get a
  warning.

* GNU sql: \n and \x0a in arguments is replaced with newline.

* Untested Debian and xUbuntu packages available through OpenSUSE
  build service:
  https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=parallel&project=home%3Atange

* Using --retries a job will be retried on another computer if it
  fails. This is useful if some jobs fail for no apparent reason (such
  as network failure).

* BSD xargs -o (open /dev/tty) is now default for the job running in
  foreground. Useful for interactive commands like:
  ls | parallel -Xuj1 vi

* GNU sql now supports SQLite.

* Renamed .dburl.aliases to .sql/aliases and /etc/sql/aliases.

* GNU sql now support --list-tables

* Alias for DBURL can contain '?query' part with %-quoting.

* sql - a small script to access sql bases from the command line which
  is a handy companion to parallel --colsep


20100822

* Counting semaphore functionality: start a job in the background. If
  N jobs are already running, wait for one to complete. Examples:
  sem 'sleep 2; echo foo'; sem 'sleep 1; echo bar'; sem --wait
  sem -j2 'sleep 2; echo foo'; sem -j2 'sleep 1; echo bar'; sem --wait

* With --colsep a table can be used as input. Example:
  cat tab_sep_table | parallel --colsep '\t' echo col1 {1} col2 {2}

* --trim can remove white space around arguments.

* --sshloginfile '..' means use ~/.parallel/sshloginfile

* New video showing the new options.
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpaiGYxkSuQ or at
  http://tinyogg.com/watch/TORaR/ and http://tinyogg.com/watch/hfxKj/

* 100% options complete with xargs. All options for xargs can now be
  used in GNU Parallel - even the more exotic.

* --basefile for transferring basedata. When running jobs on remote
  computers --basefile will transfer files before the first jobs is
  run. It can be used to transfer data that remains the same for each
  job such as scripts or lookup tables.

* --progress shows progress. To see how many jobs is running on each
  server use --progress. It can be turned on even after GNU Parallel
  is started.

* --eta shows estimated time left in seconds.

* --halt-on-error stops if an error occurs. GNU Parallel will default
  to run all jobs - even if some of them fail. With --halt-on-error
  GNU Parallel can ignore errors, wait for the currently running jobs
  to finish, or stop immediately when an error occurs.


20100601
