=head1 NAME

niceload - slow down a program when the load average is above a certain limit

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<niceload> [-v] [-h] [-n nice] [-I io] [-L load] [-M mem] [-N]
[--sensor program] [-t time] [-s time|-f factor]
( command | -p PID [-p PID ...] | --prg program )


=head1 DESCRIPTION

GNU B<niceload> will slow down a program when the load average (or
other system activity) is above a certain limit. When the limit is
reached the program will be suspended for some time. Then resumed
again for some time.  Then the load average is checked again and we
start over.

Instead of load average B<niceload> can also look at disk I/O, amount
of free memory, or swapping activity.

If the load is 3.00 then the default settings will run a program
like this:

run 1 second, suspend (3.00-1.00) seconds, run 1 second, suspend
(3.00-1.00) seconds, run 1 second, ...

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 9

=item B<-B>

=item B<--battery>

Suspend if the system is running on battery. Shorthand for: -l -1 --sensor 'cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state 2>/dev/null |grep -i -q discharging; echo $?'


=item B<-f> I<FACTOR>

=item B<--factor> I<FACTOR>

Suspend time factor. Dynamically set B<-s> as amount over limit *
factor. Default is 1.


=item B<-H>

=item B<--hard>

Hard limit. B<--hard> will suspend the process until the system is
under the limits. The default is B<--soft>.


=item B<--io> I<iolimit>

=item B<-I> I<iolimit>

Limit for I/O. The amount of disk I/O will be computed as a value 0 -
10, where 0 is no I/O and 10 is at least one disk is 100% saturated.

B<--io> will set both B<--start-io> and B<run-io>.


=item B<--load> I<loadlimit>

=item B<-L> I<loadlimit>

Limit for load average.

B<--load> will set both B<--start-load> and B<run-load>.


=item B<--mem> I<memlimit>

=item B<-M> I<memlimit>

Limit for free memory. This is the amount of bytes available as free
+ cache. This limit is treated opposite other limits: If the system
is above the limit the program will run, if it is below the limit the
program will stop

I<memlimit> can be postfixed with K, M, G, T, or P which would
multiply the size with 1024, 1048576, 1073741824, or 1099511627776
respectively.

B<--mem> will set both B<--start-mem> and B<run-mem>.


=item B<--noswap>

=item B<-N>

No swapping. If the system is swapping both in and out it is a good
indication that the system is memory stressed.

B<--noswap> is over limit if the system is swapping both in and out.

B<--noswap> will set both B<--start-noswap> and B<run-noswap>.


=item B<--net>

Shorthand for B<--nethops 3>.


=item B<--nethops> I<h>

Network nice. Pause if the internet connection is overloaded.

B<niceload> finds a router I<h> hops closer to the internet. It
B<ping>s this every second. If the latency is more than 50% bigger
than the median, it is regarded as being over the limit.

B<--nethops> can be combined with B<--hard>. Without B<--hard> the
program may be able to queue up so much traffic that it will take
longer than the B<--suspend> time to clear it. B<--hard> is useful for
traffic that does not break by being suspended for a longer time.

B<--nethops> can be combined with a high B<--suspend>. This way a
program can be allowed to do a bit of traffic now and then. This is
useful to keep the connection alive.


=item B<-n> I<niceness>

=item B<--nice> I<niceness>

Sets niceness. See B<nice>(1).


=item B<-p> I<PID>

=item B<--pid> I<PID>

Process ID of process to suspend. You can specify multiple process IDs
with multiple B<-p> I<PID>.


=item B<--prg> I<program>

=item B<--program> I<program>

Name of running program to suspend. You can specify multiple programs
with multiple B<--prg> I<program>. If no processes with the name
I<program> is found, B<niceload> with search for substrings containing
I<program>.


=item B<--quote>

=item B<-q>

Quote the command line. Useful if the command contains chars like *,
$, >, and " that should not be interpreted by the shell.


=item B<--run-io> I<iolimit>

=item B<--ri> I<iolimit>

=item B<--run-load> I<loadlimit>

=item B<--rl> I<loadlimit>

=item B<--run-mem> I<memlimit>

=item B<--rm> I<memlimit>

Run limit. The running program will be slowed down if the system is
above the limit. See: B<--io>, B<--load>, B<--mem>, B<--noswap>.


=item B<--sensor> I<sensor program>

Read sensor. Use I<sensor program> to read a sensor.

This will keep the CPU temperature below 80 deg C on GNU/Linux:

  niceload -l 80000 -f 0.001 --sensor 'sort -n /sys/devices/platform/coretemp*/temp*_input' gzip *

This will stop if the disk space < 100000.

  niceload -H -l -100000 --sensor "df . | awk '{ print \$4 }'" echo


=item B<--start-io> I<iolimit>

=item B<--si> I<iolimit>

=item B<--start-load> I<loadlimit>

=item B<--sl> I<loadlimit>

=item B<--start-mem> I<memlimit>

=item B<--sm> I<memlimit>

Start limit. The program will not start until the system is below the
limit. See: B<--io>, B<--load>, B<--mem>, B<--noswap>.


=item B<--soft>

=item B<-S>

Soft limit. B<niceload> will suspend a process for a while and then
let it run for a second thus only slowing down a process while the
system is over one of the given limits. This is the default.


=item B<--suspend> I<SEC>

=item B<-s> I<SEC>

Suspend time. Suspend the command this many seconds when the max load
average is reached.


=item B<--recheck> I<SEC>

=item B<-t> I<SEC>

Recheck load time. Sleep SEC seconds before checking load
again. Default is 1 second.


=item B<--verbose>

=item B<-v>

Verbose. Print some extra output on what is happening. Use B<-v> until
you know what your are doing.

=head1 EXAMPLE: See niceload in action

In terminal 1 run: top

In terminal 2 run:

B<niceload -q perl -e '$|=1;do{$l==$r or print "."; $l=$r}until(($r=time-$^T)>>B<50)'>

This will print a '.' every second for 50 seconds and eat a lot of
CPU. When the load rises to 1.0 the process is suspended.


=head1 EXAMPLE: Run updatedb

Running updatedb can often starve the system for disk I/O and thus result in a high load.

Run updatedb but suspend updatedb if the load is above 2.00:

B<niceload -L 2 updatedb>


=head1 EXAMPLE: Run rsync

rsync can just like updatedb starve the system for disk I/O and thus result in a high load.

Run rsync but keep load below 3.4. If load reaches 7 sleep for
(7-3.4)*12 seconds:

B<niceload -L 3.4 -f 12 rsync -Ha /home/ /backup/home/>


=head1 EXAMPLE: Ensure enough disk cache

Assume the program B<foo> uses 2 GB files intensively. B<foo> will run
fast if the files are in disk cache and be slow as a crawl if they are
not in the cache.

To ensure 2 GB are reserved for disk cache run:

B<niceload --hard --run-mem 2g foo>

This will not guarantee that the 2 GB memory will be used for the
files for B<foo>, but it will stop B<foo> if the memory for disk cache
is too low.


=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

None. In future versions $NICELOAD will be able to contain default settings.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

Exit status should be the same as the command being run (untested).

=head1 REPORTING BUGS

Report bugs to <bug-parallel@gnu.org>.
