parset - set shell variables in parallel

@node SYNOPSIS
@chapter SYNOPSIS

@strong{parset} @emph{variablename} [options for GNU Parallel]

@node DESCRIPTION
@chapter DESCRIPTION

@strong{parset} is a shell function that puts the output from GNU
@strong{parallel} into shell variables.

The @strong{parset} function is defined as part of @strong{env_parallel}.

If @emph{variablename} is a single variable name, this will be treated as
the destination variable and made to an array.

If @emph{variablename} contains multiple names separated by ',' or space,
the names will be the destination variables.

@node OPTIONS
@chapter OPTIONS

Same as GNU @strong{parallel}, but they are put @emph{after} the destination
variable.

@node Examples
@subsection Examples

Put output into @strong{myarray}:

@verbatim
  parset myarray seq 3 ::: 4 5 6
  echo "${myarray[1]}"
@end verbatim

Put output into vars @strong{$seq, $pwd, $ls}:

@verbatim
  parset "seq pwd ls" ::: "seq 10" pwd ls
  echo "$ls"
@end verbatim

Put output into vars @strong{$seq, $pwd, $ls}:

@verbatim
  into_vars=(seq pwd ls)
  parset "${into_vars[*]}" ::: "seq 10" pwd ls
  echo "$ls"
  
@end verbatim

The commands to run can be an array:

@verbatim
  cmd=("echo '<<joe  \"double  space\"  cartoon>>'" "pwd")
  parset data ::: "${cmd[@]}"
  echo "${data[0]}"
  echo "${data[1]}"
  
@end verbatim

You cannot pipe into @strong{parset}, but must use a tempfile:

@verbatim
  seq 10 > parallel_input
  parset res echo :::: parallel_input
  echo "${res[0]}"
  echo "${res[9]}"
  
@end verbatim

@node Installation
@subsection Installation

Put this in @strong{$HOME/.bashrc}:

@verbatim
  . `which env_parallel.bash`
@end verbatim

E.g. by doing:

@verbatim
  echo '. `which env_parallel.bash`' >> $HOME/.bashrc
@end verbatim
