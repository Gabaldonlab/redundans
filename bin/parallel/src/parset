=head1 NAME

parset - set shell variables in parallel


=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<parset> I<variablename> [options for GNU Parallel]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<parset> is a shell function that puts the output from GNU
B<parallel> into shell variables.

The B<parset> function is defined as part of B<env_parallel>.

If I<variablename> is a single variable name, this will be treated as
the destination variable and made to an array.

If I<variablename> contains multiple names separated by ',' or space,
the names will be the destination variables.


=head1 OPTIONS

Same as GNU B<parallel>, but they are put I<after> the destination
variable.


=head1 SUPPORTED SHELLS

=head2 Bash

=head3 Examples

Put output into B<myarray>:

  parset myarray seq 3 ::: 4 5 6
  echo "${myarray[1]}"

Put output into vars B<$seq, $pwd, $ls>:

  parset "seq pwd ls" ::: "seq 10" pwd ls
  echo "$ls"

Put output into vars B<$seq, $pwd, $ls>:

  into_vars=(seq pwd ls)
  parset "${into_vars[*]}" ::: "seq 10" pwd ls
  echo "$ls"
  
The commands to run can be an array:

  cmd=("echo '<<joe  \"double  space\"  cartoon>>'" "pwd")
  parset data ::: "${cmd[@]}"
  echo "${data[0]}"
  echo "${data[1]}"
  
You cannot pipe into B<parset>, but must use a tempfile:

  seq 10 > parallel_input
  parset res echo :::: parallel_input
  echo "${res[0]}"
  echo "${res[9]}"
  

=head3 Installation

Put this in B<$HOME/.bashrc>:

  . `which env_parallel.bash`

E.g. by doing:

  echo '. `which env_parallel.bash`' >> $HOME/.bashrc


=head1 EXIT STATUS

Same as GNU B<parallel>.
